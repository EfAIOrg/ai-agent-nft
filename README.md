## Overview

Devin.ai is a collaborative AI teammate built to help ambitious engineering teams achieve more. This test suite aims to evaluate the non-functional aspects of Devin.ai to ensure it meets the required quality standards for production use.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EfAIOrg/ai-agent-nft.git
   cd ai-agent-nft
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the environment file and configure it:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the tests, you need to configure the environment variables in the `.env` file:

- `DEVIN_API_URL`: The URL of the Devin.ai API
- `DEVIN_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your authentication token for the Devin.ai API
- Other configuration parameters as needed

## Running Tests

The test suite is organized into different categories. You can run specific test categories or all tests:

- Run all tests:
  ```
  npm run test:all
  ```

- Run specific test categories:
  ```
  npm run test:performance
  npm run test:reliability
  npm run test:security
  npm run test:scalability
  npm run test:usability
  ```

- Generate test reports:
  ```
  npm run report
  ```

## Test Categories

### 1. Performance Tests
Tests that evaluate the response time and throughput of Devin.ai under various conditions.

- **Response Time Tests**: Measure how quickly Devin.ai responds to different types of tasks.
- **Load Tests**: Evaluate how the system performs under expected load conditions.

### 2. Reliability Tests
Tests that assess the consistency and fault tolerance of Devin.ai.

- **Consistency Tests**: Verify that Devin.ai produces consistent results for the same inputs.
- **Fault Tolerance Tests**: Evaluate how the system handles and recovers from failures.

### 3. Security Tests
Tests that check the authentication, authorization, and vulnerability aspects of Devin.ai.

- **Authentication Tests**: Verify that the API properly authenticates requests.
- **API Security Scan**: Perform automated security scanning using OWASP ZAP.

### 4. Scalability Tests
Tests that evaluate how Devin.ai performs as the load increases.

- **Concurrent Task Tests**: Measure performance with increasing numbers of concurrent tasks.

### 5. Usability Tests
Tests that assess the quality and usability of Devin.ai's responses.

- **Response Quality Tests**: Evaluate if responses meet predefined quality criteria.

### 6. Maintainability Tests
Tests that evaluate the quality of code generated by Devin.ai.

- **Code Quality Tests**: Assess the complexity and documentation of generated code.

### 7. Extensibility Tests
Tests that verify Devin.ai's API versioning and extension capabilities.

- **API Versioning Tests**: Check support for different API versions.

### 8. Observability Tests
Tests that verify Devin.ai provides adequate monitoring and logging capabilities.

- **Metrics Tests**: Check if the system exposes metrics for monitoring.

### 9. Manageability Tests
Tests that verify administrative capabilities of Devin.ai.

- **Admin API Tests**: Check if the system provides administrative endpoints.

### 10. Recovery Tests
Tests that verify Devin.ai's ability to recover from errors.

- **Error Handling Tests**: Evaluate how the system handles and recovers from errors.

## Interpreting Results

After running the tests, you can find the test reports in the `reports` directory. The reports include:

- **Summary**: Overall pass/fail status of each test category
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, and other performance indicators
- **Security Findings**: Any security vulnerabilities detected
- **Detailed Logs**: Comprehensive logs for debugging failed tests

## CI/CD Integration

The test suite is designed to be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. You can use the following configuration:
